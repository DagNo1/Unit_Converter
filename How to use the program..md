# Unit_Converter
This was my 8th project on JetBrains Academy while learning Kotlin. It converts units based on the text given. It can covert temperature units, length units, and weight units.. 

To use the converter use this format
<value> <degree(if necessary)> <SI Unit> <to(any word doesn't matter)> <Result SI Unti>

For example if you want to find how many km is 132 meters is you write :- 132 meter to killometer
            if you want to find how many degree celsius is 1 degree fahrenheit you write - 1 degree fahrenheit to celsius
            if you want to find how many onces 15 grams are you write :- 15 grams to ounces
                     
                     Here are a list of recognized keywords for SI Units in this program.
          Length           
     "m", "meter", "meters" -> for meters 
    "km", "kilometer", "kilometers" -> for kilometers 
    "cm", "centimeter", "centimeters" -> for centimeters 
    "mm", "millimeter", "millimeters" -> for millimeters 
    "mi", "mile", "miles" -> for miles 
    "yd", "yard", "yards" -> for yards
    "ft", "foot", "feet" -> for feet 
    "in", "inch", "inches" -> for inch
    
          Weight
    "g", "gram", "grams" -> for grams
    "kg", "kilogram", "kilograms" -> for killograms
    "mg", "milligram", "milligrams" -> for milli grams
    "lb", "pound", "pounds" -> for pounds
    "oz", "ounce", "ounces" -> for ounces
    
            Temprature
    "degree celsius", "degrees celsius", "celsius", "dc", "c" -> for celsius
    "degree fahrenheit", "degrees fahrenheit", "fahrenheit", "df", "f" -> for fahrenheit
    "kelvin", "kelvins", "k" -> for kelvin
